# Intel Extension for PyTorch demo on MedMNIST datasets

This repository contains the training and inference code (Jupyter notebooks) for testing Intel&reg; Extension for PyTorch vs Intel&reg;-optimized PyTorch on MedMNIST datasets.
The Intel Extension for PyTorch and Intel-optimized PyTorch can be found in the Intel&reg;  oneAPI AI Analytics toolkit. More information on this toolkit and how to get it at this [link](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/ai-analytics-toolkit.html#gs.46jy1v).
Intel&reg Extension for PyTorch is a Python package to extend official PyTorch. It is designed to make the Out-of-Box user experience of PyTorch CPU better while achieving good performance. The performance gain is shown by this demo.
